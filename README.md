# **Temperature visualization project**

*I developed a machine learning model to visualise temperatures in Delhi based on climate data. The project was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries including pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.express.
The primary objective was to analyze the data and create insightful visualizations to understand temperature trends in Delhi.*

**Visualization**
---

- Visualized the model's actual temperature values using scatter plots and line plots.
- Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and trends in the Delhi climate data.
- Visualized temperature trends over time using line plots.
- Used "seaborn" and "matplotlib" to create histograms and scatter plots to identify patterns and relationships.
- Employed "plotly.express" for interactive visualizations to dynamically explore the data.
